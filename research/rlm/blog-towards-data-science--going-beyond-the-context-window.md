, context really is everything. The quality of an LLM’s output is tightly linked to the quality and amount of information you provide. In practice, many real-world use cases come with massive contexts: code generation over large codebases, querying complex knowledge systems, or even long, meandering chats while researching the perfect holiday destination (we’ve all been there).

Unfortunately, LLMs can only work efficiently with a limited amount of context. And this isn’t just about the hard limits of the context window, especially now that frontier models support hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of tokens. And those limits are continuing to grow. The bigger challenge is a phenomenon known as **context rot**, where model performance degrades as the context length increases.

This effect is clearly demonstrated in the paper [“RULER: What’s the Real Context Size of Your Long-Context Language Models?”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06654) by Hsieh et al. The authors introduce RULER, a new benchmark for evaluating long-context performance, and test a range of models. The results show a consistent pattern: as context length grows, performance drops significantly across all models. In many cases, the effective context length (where performance remains comparable to Llama 2–7B) is only around 50% of the advertised context window, or even less.

In their recent paper **[“Recursive Language Models”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601),** Zhang et al. propose a promising approach to tackling the context rot problem. In this article, I’d like to take a closer look at this idea and explore how it works in practice, leveraging DSPy’s recently added support for this inference strategy.

## Recursive Language Models 

Recursive Language Models (RLMs) were introduced to address performance degradation as context length grows, and to enable LLMs to work with very large contexts (up to two orders of magnitude beyond the model’s native context window). This is becoming increasingly important as we adopt LLMs for tasks that involve processing hundreds of millions of tokens.

There are already several approaches for handling long-horizon tasks. The most common one (something you’ve probably encountered when using code agents like Cursor) is **context summarisation**. In this setup, the conversation or working context is repeatedly summarised once it approaches the model’s context limit. In practice, however, this often falls short: important details and subtle nuances from earlier steps tend to get lost as the model “forgets” old information to make room for new tokens.

Recursive Language Models take a different, and surprisingly elegant, approach. Instead of passing the entire prompt to the LLM each time, the prompt is treated as a set of variables available in a Python REPL (Read–Eval–Print Loop) environment. The model is equipped with tools that allow it to inspect these variables or recursively invoke itself on programmatically selected fragments.

Figure from the paper Zhang et al, 2025 | [source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601)

In other words, RLMs encourage the LLM to write code that constructs its own sub-tasks, and then solve those sub-tasks by recursively calling itself. This shifts the burden from squeezing everything into a single prompt to structuring the problem in a way that the model can navigate large contexts more reliably.

The authors evaluated their approach across several long-horizon tasks, where RLMs delivered strong results on both GPT-5 and Qwen-3 models.

Figure from the paper Zhang et al, 2025 | [source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601)

The results look extremely promising. RLMs (with or without subcalls) consistently outperform other approaches across all tasks. Let’s see how this works in practice.

## Using RLM in practice 

One common scenario where long context really shines is answering questions over a large knowledge base. So that’s exactly what we’ll try here. I took all the articles I’ve published on Towards Data Science and loaded them into a single Markdown file. Somewhat surprisingly, that adds up to almost 1.5 MB of text. Hopefully, that’s enough for the model to dig through.

Fortunately, DSPy has recently introduced an implementation of the Recursive Language Models inference approach. This means we don’t need to build anything ourselves; we just need DSPy version 3.1.2 or newer.

```
pip install dspy --upgrade
```

Let’s start by loading the dataset.

```
with open('articles.md', 'r') as f:
    articles = f.read()
```

Next, let’s check how many tokens it contains.

```
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=config['ANTHROPIC_API_KEY'])

# Count tokens for messages
token_count = client.messages.count_tokens(
  model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
  messages=[
    {"role": "user", "content": articles}
  ]
)

print(f"Input tokens: {token_count.input_tokens}")
# Input tokens: 386768
```

There are almost 400K tokens in our context. Claude Sonnet 4.5 supports a 200K context window, so processing the entire dataset in a single prompt isn’t feasible. This is exactly where RLM becomes useful.

To use DSPy, we first need to configure the language model. As discussed earlier, RLM relies on code to interact with the prompt, so it works best with models that have strong coding capabilities. For this reason, I’ll use Claude in this example, since it’s known to perform well on code-related tasks.

```
lm = dspy.LM('anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5', api_key=config['ANTHROPIC_API_KEY'])
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
```

Next, we initialise the RLM by specifying its signature. In this use case, I pass the full set of articles along with a question, and expect the model to extract key trends and return them as a list of strings.

```
rlm = dspy.RLM('articles, question -> trends: list[str]')
```

> _Here, I use Claude Sonnet 4.5 for both the main model and the recursive sub-calls. DSPy also allows you to use a smaller model for sub-calls via the `sub_lm` parameter, which can help reduce costs._

Now we can execute the RLM and access the `trends` field in the output.

```
output = rlm(
  articles = articles,
  question = '''What were the main AI trends of 2025 based on provided
    articles? Pay attention to the content not only the titles.'''
)

print('\n'.join(output.trends))

# Agentic AI and Autonomous Systems: Self-reflection patterns, iterative improvement through feedback loops (Self-Refine, Reflexion, CRITIC), and LLMs as reasoning engines that can autonomously plan and execute tasks

```

The execution took around three minutes, and the result was a surprisingly plausible summary of the main themes across my articles. However, we’re not here to learn about the trends themselves. The more interesting question is how RLM managed to do this in the first place. So let’s dig deeper.

## RLM under the hood

Naturally, the most fascinating part is understanding what’s actually happening under the hood.

### RLM implementation

As discussed earlier, the key idea behind Recursive Language Models is that long contexts are treated as part of an external environment, rather than being fed directly into the model as a single prompt. Instead, the LLM writes Python code to programmatically inspect, decompose, and recursively invoke sub-LLMs over smaller snippets of the data.

At a high level, the implementation has a few core characteristics:

- It uses a sandboxed Python REPL (Read–Eval–Print Loop) that allows the LLM to explore large contexts through code execution.
- The LLM operates in a familiar agentic loop: it writes Python code, observes the output, and then decides what to do next.
- It can perform recursive sub-calls (effectively calling itself) using tools like `llm_query()` and `llm_query_batched()` to analyse smaller chunks semantically.
- Once the model is satisfied with the result, it finalises the process by calling `SUBMIT()` with the output.

### Prompts

To really understand how this works, I find it helpful to inspect the actual messages sent to and from the LLM. DSPy makes this easy with the following command.

```
# Inspect the raw LLM calls - shows the actual prompts sent to the model
dspy.inspect_history(n=39)
```

This gives us full visibility into what was shared with the model at each step.

Let’s start with the system message. It defines the input variables available to the model (as specified in the RLM signature) and lists the functions the model can call, such as `print`, recursive LLM calls, and standard library utilities.

> _Notably, the RLM module also allows you to expose custom functions to the Python REPL via the `tools` parameter when initialising the RLM. In this example, I only relied on the default functions, but in more advanced setups this can be a powerful extension point._

```
Your input fields are:
1. `variables_info` (str): Metadata about the variables available in the REPL
2. `repl_history` (REPLHistory): Previous REPL code executions and their outputs
3. `iteration` (str): Current iteration number (1-indexed) out of max_iterations
Your output fields are:
1. `reasoning` (str): Think step-by-step: what do you know? What remains? Plan your next action.
2. `code` (str): Python code to execute.
All interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.

[[ ## variables_info ## ]]
{variables_info}

[[ ## repl_history ## ]]
{repl_history}

[[ ## iteration ## ]]
{iteration}

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
{reasoning}

[[ ## code ## ]]
{code}

[[ ## completed ## ]]
In adhering to this structure, your objective is:
Given the fields `articles`, `question`, produce the fields `trends`.

You are tasked with producing the following outputs given the inputs `articles`, `question`:
- {trends}        # note: the value you produce must adhere to the JSON schema: {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}

You have access to a Python REPL environment. Write Python code and it will be executed. You will see the output, then write more code based on what you learned. This is an iterative process.

Available:
- Variables: `articles`, `question` (your input data)
- `llm_query(prompt)` - query a sub-LLM (~500K char capacity) for semantic analysis
- `llm_query_batched(prompts)` - query multiple prompts concurrently (much faster for multiple queries)
- `print()` - ALWAYS print to see results
- `SUBMIT(trends)` - submit final output when done
- Standard libraries: re, json, collections, math, etc.

IMPORTANT: This is ITERATIVE. Each code block you write will execute, you'll see the output, then you decide what to do next. Do NOT try to solve everything in one step.

1. EXPLORE FIRST - Look at your data before processing it. Print samples, check types/lengths, understand the structure.
2. ITERATE - Write small code snippets, observe outputs, then decide next steps. State persists between iterations.
3. VERIFY BEFORE SUBMITTING - If results seem wrong (zeros, empty, unexpected), reconsider your approach.
4. USE llm_query FOR SEMANTICS - String matching finds WHERE things are; llm_query understands WHAT things mean.
5. MINIMIZE RETYPING (INPUTS & OUTPUTS) - When values are long, precise, or error-prone (IDs, numbers, code, quotes), re-access them via variables and parse/compute in code instead of retyping. Use small, targeted prints to sanity-check, but avoid manual copying when variables can carry the exact value.
6. SUBMIT ONLY AFTER SEEING OUTPUTS - SUBMIT ends the current run immediately. If you need to inspect printed output, run it in one step, review the result, then call SUBMIT in a later step.

You have max 50 sub-LLM calls. When done, call SUBMIT() with your output.
```

Let’s also take a look at the first user message sent to the LLM. This gives the model an overview of the input variables: their types, lengths (so the model knows how much it can read at once), and a preview of the content to understand the structure.

Here’s the model’s initial response in line with the format specified in the user message.

```
[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
I need to analyze articles to identify main AI trends of 2025. Let me start by exploring the data:

1. First, I'll examine the structure and content of the `articles` variable to understand what I'm working with
2. I'll need to look at multiple articles, not just titles, to understand the actual content
3. Then I'll use semantic analysis (llm_query) to extract and identify trends
4. Finally, I'll compile the trends into a list

Let me start by exploring the articles data to see its structure and get a sense of what's available.

[[ ## code ## ]]
# First, let's understand the structure of the articles
print("Type of articles:", type(articles))
print("\nLength of articles:", len(articles))
print("\n" + "="*80)
print("First 2000 characters:")
print(articles[:2000])
print("\n" + "="*80)

# Let's see if we can identify the structure - looks like articles are separated
# Let's try to split and count them
article_separator = "---\ntitle:"
article_parts = articles.split(article_separator)
print(f"\nNumber of article parts found: {len(article_parts)}")
print(f"First part length: {len(article_parts[0])} (likely empty or header)")
print(f"Second part length: {len(article_parts[1]) if len(article_parts) > 1 else 0}")

[[ ## completed ## ]]
```

The raw logs gave us a solid understanding of how the LLM interacts with the environment under the hood. Next, let’s examine the trajectory the LLM followed to reach its final output.

### Trajectory 

For a structured view of the trajectory, we can inspect `output.trajectory`. This gives access to each step of the model’s reasoning, the code it generates, and the resulting outputs. Essentially, it provides a comprehensive view of all REPL interactions.

```
# Examine the full trajectory - this shows all REPL interactions
for i, step in enumerate(output.trajectory):
  print(f"\n{'='*60}")
  print(f"STEP {i+1}")
  print(f"{'='*60}")
  print(f"\n📝 REASONING:\n{step['reasoning']}")
  print(f"\n💻 CODE:\n{step['code']}")
  print(f"\n📤 OUTPUT:\n{step['output'][:1000]}{'...' if len(step['output']) > 1000 else ''}")
```

> _You can also find the full log on [GitHub](https://github.com/miptgirl/miptgirl_medium/blob/main/dspy_rlm/dspy_rlm.ipynb)._

Reviewing the trajectory helps us understand the main patterns the LLM uses to solve the problem. In this case, it took 13 steps to reach the final answer.

The first step, as expected, was exploring the `articles` variable: examining its structure and getting a sense of the available data. This initial exploration sets the stage for all subsequent reasoning and sub-calls.

```
# First, let's understand the structure of the articles
print("Type of articles:", type(articles))
print("\nLength of articles:", len(articles))
print("\n" + "="*80)
print("First 2000 characters:")
print(articles[:2000])
print("\n" + "="*80)

# Let's see if we can identify the structure - looks like articles are separated
# Let's try to split and count them
article_separator = "---\ntitle:"
article_parts = articles.split(article_separator)
print(f"\nNumber of article parts found: {len(article_parts)}")
print(f"First part length: {len(article_parts[0])} (likely empty or header)")
print(f"Second part length: {len(article_parts[1]) if len(article_parts) > 1 else 0}")
```

Next, the LLM realised that there were 40 articles in total, each separated by `---\ntitle:`, and that every article contained metadata fields like `title`, `date`, `category`, `read_time`, and `url`, followed by the main content. Just identifying this structure from a 1.5 MB text file is already a significant achievement.

Building on this understanding, the LLM then parsed the articles and generated a summary of the article titles and main themes. 

```
# Parse articles into structured format
import re

# Split by the article separator
raw_articles = articles.split("---\ntitle:")

# Process each article (skip the first empty element)
parsed_articles = []
for i, raw_article in enumerate(raw_articles[1:], 1):  # Skip first empty element
  # Add back the "title:" that was removed by split
  raw_article = "title:" + raw_article

  # Extract metadata using regex
  title_match = re.search(r'title:\s*"([^"]*)"', raw_article)
  date_match = re.search(r'date:\s*"([^"]*)"', raw_article)
  category_match = re.search(r'category:\s*"([^"]*)"', raw_article)

  # Find where content starts (after the second "---")
  content_start = raw_article.find("---", 10)  # Skip the first part
  content = raw_article[content_start+3:].strip() if content_start != -1 else ""

  parsed_articles.append({
    'index': i,
    'title': title_match.group(1) if title_match else "Unknown",
    'date': date_match.group(1) if date_match else "Unknown",
    'category': category_match.group(1) if category_match else "Unknown",
    'content': content,
    'content_length': len(content)
  })

print(f"Successfully parsed {len(parsed_articles)} articles\n")
print("="*80)
print("Sample of articles (titles and categories):")
print("="*80)
for i, article in enumerate(parsed_articles[:10], 1):
  print(f"{i}. [{article['category']}] {article['title']}")
  print(f"   Content length: {article['content_length']} chars")
  print()
```

After parsing the articles, the LLM decided to focus exclusively on AI-related content, since the question specifically asked about AI trends.

```
# Let's focus on AI-related articles (AI, Agentic AI, LLM Applications, ChatGPT categories)
# and sample strategically to understand content-based trends

ai_related = [a for a in parsed_articles if a['category'] in [
  'Artificial Intelligence', 'Agentic AI', 'LLM Applications', 'ChatGPT', 'Deep Learning'
]]
```

Next, the LLM identified the key articles it wanted to focus on. It was a subjective selection based on relevance and content. To analyse these in detail, it used recursive sub-calls, processing each article programmatically.

To manage the workload efficiently, the LLM split the articles into two batches and processed them sequentially. For each article, it also truncated the content to the first 15K characters. This strategy allowed the model to handle a large volume of text without exceeding its context window, while still capturing the most important insights from each article.

```
# Create prompts to extract AI trends from article content
# I'll include a substantial portion of each article's content for analysis

prompts_batch1 = []

for i, article in enumerate(selected_for_analysis[:8]):  # First batch of 8
  # Take first ~15K chars of content to stay within LLM limits while getting substance
  content_sample = article['content'][:15000]

  prompt = f"""Analyze this article about AI from 2025 and identify the main AI trends, technologies, methodologies, or concepts it discusses.

Article Title: {article['title']}

Article Content (excerpt):
{content_sample}

- New frameworks, tools, or methodologies mentioned
- Emerging patterns in AI development (e.g., agentic AI, multi-agent systems)
- Important techniques or approaches
- Production/deployment considerations

Provide a concise list of 3-5 main trends/concepts from this article."""

  prompts_batch1.append(prompt)

print(f"Created {len(prompts_batch1)} prompts for first batch")
print("\nProcessing first batch of articles...")

# Query the first batch
results_batch1 = llm_query_batched(prompts_batch1)

print(f"\nReceived {len(results_batch1)} results")
print("\nResults from first batch:")
print("="*80)

for i, (article, result) in enumerate(zip(selected_for_analysis[:8], results_batch1), 1):
  print(f"\n{i}. {article['title']}")
  print("-"*80)
  print(result)
  print()
```

Finally, the LLM reviewed the full list of articles once more, identified additional relevant topics, and processed them using recursive sub-calls in the same way. Once all the information had been retrieved, it synthesised the results into the `trends_2025` variable (a list of strings representing the main AI trends) and submitted it as the final answer.

```

SUBMIT(trends_2025)
```

We can see that the model was quite creative: it understood the structure of our content, parsed the articles, and used recursive calls to process each one individually. However, there was one significant gap in this analysis. It completely overlooked filtering by year, even though the metadata for each article clearly contained the publication date.

To address this, I repeated the request, this time emphasising the importance of filtering for 2025, to ensure the model focused only on articles from that year.

```
output2 = rlm(
  articles = articles,
  question = '''What were the main AI trends of 2025 based on provided
    articles? Pay attention to the content not only the titles.
    Don\'t forget to filter by year, this information is present in
    metadata for each article.'''
)
```

This time, the model considered the year and performed more sophisticated parsing, using regular expressions to extract the publication date for each article.

```
import re
from datetime import datetime

# Split articles by the separator "---" at the beginning of metadata blocks
# The pattern is: --- followed by metadata, followed by --- followed by content
article_blocks = re.split(r'\n---\n', articles)

print(f"Total article blocks found: {len(article_blocks)}")
print("\n" + "="*80)

# Let's examine the structure - articles seem to start with "---\ntitle:"
# Let me try a different approach - find all articles by their metadata pattern
article_pattern = r'---\ntitle: "(.*?)"\ndate: "(.*?)"\ncategory: "(.*?)"\nread_time: "(.*?)"\nurl: "(.*?)"\n---\n(.*?)(?=\n---\ntitle:|$)'

matches = re.findall(article_pattern, articles, re.DOTALL)
print(f"Articles found with regex: {len(matches)}")

if len(matches) > 0:
  print("\nFirst article metadata:")
  print(f"  Title: {matches[0][0]}")
  print(f"  Date: {matches[0][1]}")
  print(f"  Category: {matches[0][2]}")
  print(f"  Content preview (first 200 chars): {matches[0][5][:200]}")
```

Next, it filtered the articles by year and identified 13 articles from 2025.

```
# Parse articles and filter for 2025
articles_2025 = []

for match in matches:
  title, date_str, category, read_time, url, content = match
  # Extract year from date string (format: "2025-10-24T12:00:00-05:00")
  year = date_str.split('-')[0]

  if year == "2025":
    articles_2025.append({
      'title': title,
      'date': date_str,
      'category': category,
      'content': content.strip()
    })

print(f"Total articles: {len(matches)}")
print(f"Articles from 2025: {len(articles_2025)}")
print("\n" + "="*80)
print("2025 Articles:")
print("="*80)

for i, article in enumerate(articles_2025, 1):
  print(f"\n{i}. {article['title']}")
  print(f"   Date: {article['date']}")
  print(f"   Category: {article['category']}")
  print(f"   Content length: {len(article['content'])} chars")
```

Then, it analysed these 13 articles using recursive sub-calls and produced an updated list of trends. This time, the task was completed correctly. As with many other examples, it highlights the importance of asking clear, explicit questions and specifying the criteria and actions we want the model to follow.

## Summary

It’s time to wrap things up and reflect on what we’ve learned. In this article, we explored RLM (Recursive Language Models) — a new inference strategy that allows LLMs to handle contexts up to two orders of magnitude larger than their standard context window, while mitigating the context rot problem.

I’m genuinely fascinated by this approach. The paper proposes a simple yet elegant method of treating prompts as variables in a Python environment, which reminds me of my favourite agentic framework, [smolagents](https://towardsdatascience.com/code-agents-the-future-of-agentic-ai/) by HuggingFace. I believe this method is especially efficient because LLMs have been trained on so much code that programming feels like a native language to them. Using code as the interface for reasoning and recursion is both practical and powerful.

Overall, Recursive Language Models offer a practical and elegant way to push the limits of context length, making LLMs more capable of handling complex, large-scale tasks. However, clear instructions and thoughtful guidance are still key to getting the best results.
